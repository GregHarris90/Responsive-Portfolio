# The Repository

- This repository is an introduction to who I am as a person. Where I share some brief information about myself, tell you what I'm passionate about, show some photos of my family, mention my future goals, and leave a contact page.

- I wanted to create a Responsive Portfolio Website using Bootstrap v4.5, html, and some css that allows the user to learn about and/or contact me. While the webpage also retains it's function and displays properly regardless of the size or kind of web browser that's being used.

# User Story

- Anyone viewing my website will be able to read about me, see some pictures of my life, and gain some insight into who I am and where I want to go from here! The user should be able to easily navigate between three pages, the 'About Me,' 'Photo Gallery,' and ' Contact Page.' This portfolio will hopefully assist in the task of introducing myself, meet other like minded people, and share what I can while learning more about them.

# Responsive Portfolio

- While building this Responsive Portfolio I came across many different hurtles that I had to work to figure out and/or overcome. Below I share some what I struggled with most on each page and where I need to improve. 

# Webpage Challenges

## About Me:

- The hardest part on the 'About Me' page was getting the Navbar working properly and making sure it collapsed and operated correctly when I minimized the browser, while also having working links and dropdown button. I realized I didn't put the proper jquery links from Bootstrap, and once I figured this out applying it to the other pages was far easier.

## Photo Gallery:

- When working with images in the 'Gallery' section it was difficult to ensure the proper spacing and alignment of all the photos in each row and column. This part took a lot of trial and error until I got them working as intended. I still wish to play around with their sizing as you'll find one image in the center column is quite larger than the others.

## Contact:

- I had to spend sometime working on building the structure of this page as the 'Contact' box didn't quite work at first or appear the way it did in the provided example. After creating the appropriate text boxes, I had to spend a lot of time working on how this card operated on the webpage. I feel like I can still improve it's functionality if given more time.

## HTML Validation Errors

I ran out of time to go through these last errors in my code for the Responsive Portfolio webpage. I will spend some extra effort going over these issues, correct them, and watch out for them in future! Still need to practice using tools like html validation to better my code!

# Overall Conclusion

 The Responsive Portfolio assignment taught me how to use Bootstrap v4.5 to structure multiple webpages, connect them to eachother, and create various elements with certain functions that are found throughout this project.
 
 The greatest lesson from this assignment was learning how hard it is to build something from scratch. I know my instructor has called it the "blank-page" problem, and it truly was definitely difficult starting each page from nothing.
 
 But once I was able to get started the process became easier, while also more fun as it went along. My favorite part of this project was after laying down the foundation of each page and then being able to spend time bringing in images and playing with the text. 
 
 Overall I know I need more practice working on the frontend of Web Design, but this project was a great exercise at getting me started and showing me how it all works!
