# The Repository

- This repository is an intorduction to who I am as a person. Where I share some brief information about myself, tell you what I'm passionate about, show some photos of my family, mention my future goals, and leave a contact page.

- I wanted to create a Responsive Portfolio Website using Bootstrap v4.5, html and some css that allows the user to learn about or contact me. While the webpage retains it's function and displays properly regardless of the size or kind of web browser that's being used.

# User Story

- Anyone viewing my website will be able to read about me, see some pictures of my life, and gain some insight into who I am and where I want to go from here! The user should be able to easily navigate between three pages, the 'About Me,' 'Photo Gallery,' and ' Contact Page.' Such webpages will hopefully assist in the task of introducing myself, meet other like minded people, and share what I can while learning more them.

# Responsive Portfolio

- While building this Responsive Portfolio I ran into a wall various times and came across many different hurtles that I had to work to figure out and/or overcome. Below I share some examples of what I struggled with most on each page and where I need to improve.

## HTML Validation Errors

I ran out of time to go through these last errors in my code for the Responsive Portfolio webpage. I will spend some extra time going over these issues, correct them, and watch out for them in future!

# Overall Conclusion

 The Responsive Portfolio assignment taught me how to use Bootstrap v4.5 to structure multiple webpages, connect them to eachother, and create various elements with certain functions that are found throughout this project.
 
 The greatest lesson from this assignment was learning how hard it is to build something from scratch. I know my instructor has called it the "blank-page" problem, and it truly was definitely difficult starting each page from nothing.
 
 But once I was able to get started the process became easier, while also more fun as it went along. My favorite part of this project was after laying down the foundation of each page and then being able to spend time bringing in images and playing with the text. 
 
 Overall I know I need more practice working on the frontend of Web Design, but this project was a great exercise at getting me started and showing me how it all works!
